#  Flexbox - Foot Locker

Originally the exercise was mentioned on [CoderAcademy HTML-CSS challenges](https://github.com/CoderAcademy-MEL/html-css-challenges/blob/master/03-flexbox.md) but the layout had changed so I tried to rebuild the [the product page](https://www.footlocker.co.uk/en/category/sale/men/shoes.html) using HTML, CSS including Flexbox.
