# My frontend resources

## Track

I subscribed to the [Web Developer Bootcamp 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) by [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/). I found it was a good starting point but I wanted to dig deeper. 

I also found this [Frontend developer roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) an usefull guideline.

So in addition to Colt Steeles course, I used following resources. There are many, many more good resources on the web. I felt however the necessity to stick to one or two.
